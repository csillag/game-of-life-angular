## Game of Life

This is a Typescript + Meteor + Angular implementation of the Game of Life,
loosely inspired by https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/

If you want to run in, you need to install [Meteor](http://meteor.com/),
and then run `make dev`.

Since this project is client-only, it can be deployed at any static hosting
solution. For building it that way, it depends on the [meteor-build-client](https://github.com/frozeman/meteor-build-client) tool.
